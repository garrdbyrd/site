&lt;p>I am at a point where I very much enjoy blogs. Without mentioning the buzz word to end all buzz words (that two-letter intialism), I&amp;rsquo;ll emphasize that the value of human expression is at a local maximum. Humans need to create things, get things wrong, and have discussions with other humans.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When I think back to how I have felt about blogs throughout my life, there are really three main phases (if I am being overly structured). &amp;ldquo;Phase 1&amp;rdquo; would be my early childhood. Growing up in the 00s, I was fortunate enough to be child in a world which was still coasting off of the cultural optimism of the nineties. Along with this came the perspective of watching the rapid development of technology. I don&amp;rsquo;t think I had an accurate perspective on what a &amp;ldquo;blog&amp;rdquo; actually was, moreso imagery deriving from &lt;em>Zoey 101&lt;/em> and similar television shows. That is, a blog was something a teenage girl would use to talk about music and boys, not something for any kind of technical discussion. In retrospect, there were a variety of sites which I would frequent which were essentially individuals talking about things they enjoy, find interesting, etc. Among these was &lt;a href="https://www.dragonflycave.com">dragonflycave.com&lt;/a>, which I am glad to see is still up. The site discussed various Pokemon-related things; e.g., providing in-game sprites and a tutorial on sprite &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="https://www.dragonflycave.com/spriting-guide">splicing&lt;/a>&amp;rdquo; (e.g., putting the arms of a geodude onto a voltorb).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Phase 2&amp;rdquo; would be my teenage years, up until about the end of grad school. My only real opinion I held during this time was the blogs are part of &amp;ldquo;the old internet&amp;rdquo;, an idea which I had a respect for, but did not long for in the way I do now. The final phase would be where I am at now. The internet is a terrible, commercial place. Finding a site where someone is explaining something technical, or even expressing an opinion in greater than 140 characters is an oasis in the desert.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you have found your way to my tiny corner, please consider blogging in any way/shape/form. Use substack, make a static site with hugo (the source code for this site can be found &lt;a href="https://github.com/garrdbyrd/site/tree/main">here&lt;/a>, go ahead and use it), hell, use SquareSpace or WordPress. Express an idea in a medium/long format. Tell the world about an album you listened to, or the latest, weirdest meal you&amp;rsquo;ve made for dinner, write a short bit of fiction.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Human ideas are valuable. Thanks for reading.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>GB&lt;/p>
