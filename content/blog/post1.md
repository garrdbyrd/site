Although this initial post will be without much substance, I'd figured that getting _something_ up onto the site would grease the wheels for further thoughts.

I am at a point where I very much enjoy blogs. Without mentioning the buzz word to end all buzz words (that two-letter intialism), I'll emphasize that the value of human expression is at a local maximum. Humans need to create things, get things wrong, and have discussions with other humans.

When I think back to how I have felt about blogs throughout my life, there are really three main phases (if I am being overly structured). "Phase 1" would be my early childhood. Growing up in the 00s, I was fortunate enough to be child in a world which was still coasting off of the cultural optimism of the nineties. Along with this came the perspective of watching the rapid development of technology. I don't think I had an accurate perspective on what a "blog" actually was, moreso imagery deriving from _Zoey 101_ and similar television shows. That is, a blog was something a teenage girl would use to talk about music and boys, not something for any kind of technical discussion. In retrospect, there were a variety of sites which I would frequent which were essentially individuals talking about things they enjoy, find interesting, etc. Among these was [dragonflycave.com](https://www.dragonflycave.com), which I am glad to see is still up. The site discussed various Pokemon-related things; e.g., providing in-game sprites and a tutorial on sprite "[splicing](https://www.dragonflycave.com/spriting-guide)" (e.g., putting the arms of a geodude onto a voltorb).

"Phase 2" would be my teenage years, up until about the end of grad school. My only real opinion I held during this time was the blogs are part of "the old internet", an idea which I had a respect for, but did not long for in the way I do now. The final phase would be where I am at now. The internet is a terrible, commercial place. Finding a site where someone is explaining something technical, or even expressing an opinion in greater than 140 characters is an oasis in the desert.

If you have found your way to my tiny corner, please consider blogging in any way/shape/form. Use substack, make a static site with hugo (the source code for this site can be found [here](https://github.com/garrdbyrd/site/tree/main), go ahead and use it), hell, use SquareSpace or WordPress. Express an idea in a medium/long format. Tell the world about an album you listened to, or the latest, weirdest meal you've made for dinner, write a short bit of fiction.

Human ideas are valuable. Thanks for reading.
