Yes, I bought a Switch 2. I paid $534.99 including tax at my local Target. I got the last one, so sorry to all the kids who got there after about 5:15pm today.

I really don't play the original Switch much at all. That machine stays at my parents' house and we ocassionally use it to play _Mario Kart 8_ when I visit family (and truth be told on this, I'm really more of a _Mario Party_ guy).

To drag this point out even further, I don't even play games that much even more. I don't say this with any kind of pride; I do love interactive narratives, and there are countless wonderful experiences that are on my video game bucket list. (This is not to praise products like Fortnite, League of Legends, or Call of Duty. These are soulless experiences designed to get children addicted to gambling.) Still, I left work this Monday evening and headed straight to Best Buy (which was expectedly out of stock) and then to Target to acquire the latest Nintendo hardware.

Is it overpriced? No, not really. The Sony PS3 released for $500 in 2006 (that's nearly $800 in 2025 $USD, granted it did play a dual-role as a Blu-Ray player), and console prices have floated around $400-$500 ever since. The Switch 2 costs $450, $500 to get _Mario Kart World_ included.

Are the games overpriced? Yeah, probably. Still, it's a miracle that the $60 standard for a new game has lasted this long. That's been the standard since the late 90s (citation needed); adjusting for inflation, that's about $30 for a new game in 2005 money. No wonder AAA studios are packing their products with more micro-transactions than an amoeba's garage sale. My point here is not that my heart is bleeding for these piece of shit companies (fuck you Blizzard, Konami, Ubisoft, and all the others except maybe From Software). My point is that I'm shocked that major game releases haven't jumped in price sooner. $80 for _Mario Kart_? Not for me, but I was fortunate enough to functionally get it for $50 as part of the bundle.

$70 for Donkey Kong? When I say "fuck you" to AAA studios, of course this includes Nintendo. The company has a long history of fighting its patrons in many different ways. One of the more upsetting is there continual fight against the archiving and documentation of discontinued products, though Nintendo is hardly unique in this regard. As I'll mention below, they also struggle to properly credit their creative staff. So why am I indulging in the $70 premium for a new title? Well, I'm not particularly proud of that induglence, but what can I say? I like Donkey Kong. (Also there are some other titles, including _Kirby Air Riders_ and _Totally Not Bloodborne 2_ that I'll be picking up.)

What's it like actually playing on the damn thing? It's nice. It's a beautiful piece of hardware, and it might have the nicest screen I've ever purchased. The colors are colorful, the blacks are black, etc., etc. I was actually shocked to learn that it's not an OLED screen, it really does look nice for an LCD. The buttons are clicky as hell, the joysticks are comfortable (give it a year or two to see if the stick drift problem re-emerges), and the built-in stand is great. So far, I actually fold out the stand whole I hold it in my hands for further support. To detach the joycons, there's a simple button/lever combo that feels super nice; the magnets are _firm_, which makes it super satisfying to attach/detach them.

So how are the games? Well, I haven't purchased any. As mentioned, I did get a digital copy of _Mario Kart World_, but I haven't even redeemed it yet. How about the new Donkey Kong game? That doesn't come out until next month! But I still haven't lied with my title. The first and only game I've played so far is _Donkey Kong Country_, which I played through the virtual SNES software on the Switch 2.

Damn, it felt good to sit on the couch and play a video game. I made it through the first world of DKC (_Kongo Jungle_), stopping after having beaten the first boss, _Very Gnawty_. This game is a masterpiece, and playing it on my couch in my living room on a big TV transported me away from the desk/chair/monitor setup I'm accustomed to (in the best of ways). The three _Donkey Kong Country_ games were some of the first games I played as a young boy. Born in '99, I actually had these available in conjunction with many Nintendo 64 titles. These cartridges included, naturally, _Donkey Kong 64_.

DKC and DK64 are near and dear to my heart. Their influence on my musicianship cannot be overstated. David Wise (DKC) and Grant Kirkhope (DK64) are wonderful composers who have influenced many in the video game composition world, and Nintendo have demonstrated disregard for them by not crediting these composers for their contributions in later works. E.g., Kirkhope's _DK Rap_ was used in the Mario movie without credits.

Although I majored in applied math, I also minored in music theory during my undergraduate studies. My senior year, I was fortunate enough to work with a wonderful member of the music department faculty at UTK under whom I took an independent study course for my final music theory credits. I can't recall the exact name of the project, but the thesis was a comprison of the composition techniques of Wise and Kirkhope in _Donkey Kong Country_ and _Donkey Kong 64_ that highlighted some more complex techniques utilized by Kirkhope (namely the usage of "adaptive music"), which mirrored the complexity of a 3D game compared to a 2D game.

I could ramble for too long about the... _difficulties_... of DK64. I recommend Dunkey's playthrough of the game; Dunkey is a beyond-charming, long-time internet personality, and his struggles during this playthrough highlight many of the game's pain points. Nevertheless, it should suffice to say that, despite its flaws, the only _real_ 3D Donkey Kong game fills my soul with nostalgia for polygonal apes and low-resolution banana textures. This is the crux of my $500 Donkey Kong Machine. On July 17, _Donkey Kong Bonanza_ is being released for the Switch 2, and I'll be there to give DK's new design for a spin.

Is Nintendo a huge, money-hungry company? Oh yeah. But do their games still have soul? For me, yes. They're pretty regularly trying new things, _occasionally_ showing love to older gems, such as the _Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door_ remake (that remake had so much love and respect poured into it), and demonstrate some level of quality and charm in their works. Their shit usually _runs_ at launch, which is a depressingly low bar to set. At least, this is compared to the likes of Microsoft, Sony, Epic, Riot, and others who produce the video game equivalents of Chicken McNuggets. (More precisely, Chicken McNuggets that are sold through a subscription service... with the option to pay extra for blinking lights on the cardboard box.)

Anyway, I'm gonna go play more _Donkey Kong Country_ on my $500 (lobotomized?) (pimped out?) SNES.

Also, it's worth mentioning that this was acquiring to play games with my family. It's not just a device that will sit in my apartment as a decoration, it will see usage through the few of us playing what I expect to be many wonderful titles. Especiallly Donkey Kong.

Primate games are fun. Thanks for reading.
