# Owl City's *Maybe I'm Dreaming*

I push myself to explore new music every year. Since 2023, I've kept Spotify playlists that track every album that I listen to for the first time that year. (Maybe I'll write about these one day.) Despite this, I'm a pretty firm believer that we never stray far from the music we listen to when we're a teenager. For myself, this would be Glass Animals, David Bowie, Avenged Sevenfold, and many others, undoubtedly including the icon of 00s electronica (no, not The Postal Service), **Owl City**.

If one were to describe *Maybe I'm Dreaming* in the abstract way coffee roasters describe their latest batch of beans, the words *melancholic*, *longing*, and *lonely* would likely be the note descriptors on the front of the bag. In future write-ups, we'll explore how Owl City's sound diverges from the solemn, relatable-to-all-hipsters mood of their early work. Yes, this album precedes even *Fireflies*.
